# LandMonkClient

## About
* LandMonk is a property management software that empowers landlords to self-manage their rental homes and apartments.

## My Developer Role
* Created the database with CRUD functions using MySQL and .NET by contributing the following:
* 1. Created the components CreateProperty, DeleteProperty, and Update Property 
* 2. Set up the routes for the users to implement CRUD functions on their properties 
* 3. Created the search bar so that users may look up tenants by their name, email, phone number, zip code, or city
* 4. Set the CreateUnit function for properties in order to add units to different properties
* 5. Used Redux in order to create a redux-store for the components to call different functions


## Installation

npm install
npm start

Server-side code is in my `MichaelKLandMonkAPI` repository.
